**git clone https://github.com/RubenVerster/visio-homepage.git**

once the repo is cloned, cd into it and run:
**npm i**
This installs the dependencies for node-sass

Once you've installed the dependency packages, you can open the index.html file with Live Server in VSCode, or just run it locally in your browser
